'''hw5p1sol.py

   This is the solution code for HW5 Problem 1.

   This should re-use the trajectory construction from HW4 P4.

   It is also updated to properly handle shut down when the trajectory
   runs out of segments.  And provides the time step (dt) to the
   evaluation, in preparation for the coming inverse kinematics.  The
   generator node itself is pulled into a seperately file.

   Node:        /generator
   Publish:     /joint_states           sensor_msgs/JointState
